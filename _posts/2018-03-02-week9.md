<h3>USS Strikes</h3>
<p>
It is with a heavy heart that I have joined the UCU strike action, as is my legal right. This is not due to my lack of support, I am fully supportive of the UCU 
strike action, due to the proposed cuts to academic and academic related pensions. After almost 13 years of paying into my once final salary pension, it pains me 
that I will not be getting the pension I signed up for when I joined the HE sector. How it is possible that this part of my contract can constantly be updated is 
beyond me. How am I supposed to plan for my old age, when every few years my pension is significantly altered? 
</p>
<p>I am sad to be joining this strike action as I love my job and strive to give the best possible service to the staff, students, and public 
who use the services I and my team deliver.
