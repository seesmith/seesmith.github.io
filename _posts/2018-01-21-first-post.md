Well. Finally got around to putting this website together, it was one of my aims for 2018. It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use markdown to author my posts. The tutorial I followed is at <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/</a>
