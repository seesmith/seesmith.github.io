<p>I finally got around to putting this website together, it was one of my aims for 2018, inspired by my <a href="https://www.lfhe.ac.uk/en/programmes-events/equality-and-diversity/aurora/index.cfm" title="LFHE Aurora" target="_blank">LFHE Aurora</a> mentor and desire to keep a better log of the different projects I work on.</p>

<p>One of the many great things about working at the University of Edinburgh is the support given for continuous professional development. I have been fortunate to go on many training programmes organised by the Learning and Development Team. This year I am part of the University's Aurora programme cohort, a leadership programme for women in higher education. The Aurora days, prep work and meetings with my mentor are challenging me to consider my goals, aspirations and skillset.

<p>It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and enablint the use of markdown to author my posts. The tutorial I followed is at <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/</a></p>
